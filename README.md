# Homelab

Hello everyone!

I will use this space to share with you what I do in my home lab.
I hope that someone with a higher seniority than mine can give me advice on what can be improved and things you can add and to create new connections with people who have the same passions as me.

## What do I have available

I recently bought a second-hand Raspberry Pi (The prices of these toys have skyrocketed lately due to supply chain problems).
It's a 4 GB RAM, Isn't it very tender?
